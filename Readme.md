------------ Face-API.js Documentation ---------------
Introduction
Face-API.js is a JavaScript library that provides face detection, face recognition, and facial landmark detection capabilities using pre-trained deep learning models. It allows developers to work with facial data in web applications, making it possible to build various face-related features, such as facial recognition, emotion detection, face tracking, and more.

This documentation will provide an overview of Face-API.js, its features, how to get started, and some code examples to demonstrate its usage.

Features
Face-API.js offers a wide range of features, including:

Face Detection: Detects faces in images and videos with high accuracy.

Face Recognition: Recognizes faces and can match them to known individuals, making it useful for building facial recognition systems.

Facial Landmark Detection: Identifies facial landmarks like eyes, nose, and mouth, enabling precise tracking and analysis.

Face Expression Analysis: Can determine facial expressions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

Age and Gender Estimation: Estimates the age and gender of detected faces.

Face Pose Estimation: Calculates the head pose (yaw, pitch, and roll) of a face.

Face Alignment: Aligns faces for consistent positioning and analysis.

Multi-Face Detection: Detects multiple faces within an image.

Browser Compatibility: Works in modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
